# Smart-Mirror

## Problem Statement

Design a smart mirror using a raspberry pi, lcd screen and two way mirror. You have to create a GUI layout to display contents like news feed, date and time, weather reports, present timetable and fetch important events from your email. Modules for fetching some of the data are already built in python. You can use dedicated GUI(Graphical USer Interface) library like PyQT, tkinter etc or use python as backend and make frontend in HTML, CSS, JS.
